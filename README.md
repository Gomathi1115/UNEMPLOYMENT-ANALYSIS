🌍 Project Spotlight: Global Unemployment Data Analysis (2014–2024) 📊✨
Excited to showcase my latest project where I analyzed global unemployment trends across age groups, gender, and countries. Using innovative visualizations, this project highlights critical labor market insights. 🌟

🔍 Project Highlights:
1. Data Preparation:

Processed a dataset spanning unemployment statistics from 2014 to 2024, grouped by age, gender, and country.
Cleaned and transformed data to enable in-depth analysis and accurate visualizations.
2. Visual Insights:

Area Chart: Showcased unemployment trends across different age categories, highlighting variations over the decade.
Bubble Chart: Compared unemployment counts between male and female populations by age groups, providing a visual balance of labor market disparities.
Radar Chart: Normalized unemployment data to illustrate multi-year trends for various countries, offering a comparative view of regional dynamics.
Waterfall Chart: Highlighted year-over-year changes in unemployment for specific countries, emphasizing areas of improvement or decline.
3. Analysis Highlights:

Explored age-group trends to uncover which demographics were most affected by unemployment shifts.
Gender-specific comparisons revealed imbalances in unemployment rates between male and female populations.
Country-level visualizations provided a comprehensive understanding of labor market variations globally.
💡 Key Takeaways:
This project emphasized the power of visualization in understanding global unemployment dynamics. It also underscored the importance of addressing demographic-specific issues to promote equitable labor opportunities.
